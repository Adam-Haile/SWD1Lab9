ParkingLot Program (cont.)  

Assignment:  
The previous version of the District class you delivered was limited to districts with three parking lots. This was an artificial limit, and you have been contracted to revise the code to support up to twenty parking lots per district. You are to replace the lot1, lot2, and lot3 instance variables in District by an array, lots, of ParkingLot items. The array is to support up to 20 parking lots. You will introduce a variable numLots to track the number of parking lots currently in use. In addition, you will make a small modification to ParkingLot as described below.
